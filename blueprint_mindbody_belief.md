# Blueprint: Integrating Belief, Mind-Body & Medicine in IHEP

## Data Model / Tracking
- Integrate a "Belief/Optimism Index" (self-reported by patient or observed by care team)
- Track hope, optimism, gratitude, and social support as structured fields in patient record
- Digital twins include psychosocial trends in reporting

## Agentic / Workflow Design
- Each patient touchpoint includes motivation/optimism assessment and encouragement
- Care plans automatically surface positive milestones as part of digital twin summary
- LLM/Agent suggestions always explain not just clinical, but also psychological and social benefits

## Social Structures
- Guidance for peer mentorship, family/friend involvement, and support group integration
- Celebrate individual and group "belief milestones" (e.g., through digital badges, support group events)
- Materials for spiritual/cultural leader partnership to enable faith-based and culturally congruent resilience modules
