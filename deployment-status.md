## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

You'll need to run these commands in your own Google Cloud environment:

1. **Authenticate with Google Cloud**
2. **Set project to ihep-app**
3. **Run deployment script**
4. **Configure domain nameservers**
5. **Add API keys to Secret Manager**

## ⚡ Performance Expectations

- **99.9% Uptime** with multi-zone redundancy
- **Auto-scaling** from 10-25 instances based on demand
- **5-second failover** between load balancers
- **10,000+ concurrent users** capacity
- **Sub-100ms response times** with CDN
